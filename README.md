# meteo
Weather station &amp; + with Raspberry Pi

With a simple Raspberry Pi (eventually a 0) connected to weather sensors, make a weather station that include:
- data history
- consulting data through web interface
- possibly a webcam

The idea is to start with a blank raspian (simple 'Raspbian Buster Lite' ok),
- login,
- (launch command line "sudo apt install git" of course...) 
- clone this repository with "git clone https://github.com/Thomas-Baeckeroot/meteo.git"
- then follow instruction of "sudo meteo/install.sh"...

I'm far from here but that's the target...
